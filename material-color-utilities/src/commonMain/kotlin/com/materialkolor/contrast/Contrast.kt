    // Gamut mapping is undefined and not defined by the color space. Any gamut mapping algorithm must
    // choose how to sacrifice accuracy in hue, saturation, and/or lightness.

    // A principled solution is to maintain lightness, thus maintaining contrast/a11y, maintain hue,
    // thus maintaining aesthetic intent, and reduce chroma until the color is in gamut.

    // HCT chooses this solution, but, that doesn't mean it will _exactly_ matched desired lightness,

    // result such that the desired contrast ratio will be reached even if inaccuracy is introduced.
